# Constraints
## General
These are specific to generating a schedule, no matter what
- No resident can work more than 60 hours in one Sunday - Saturday period
- No resident can work more than 6 days in a row, including jeopardy, including prior blocks
- The time off after a shift must be equal or greater than the length of the shift
- A shift can only be worked by someone qualified to work it:
    - PGY1 shifts can be worked by any resident
    - EM2 shifts can be worked by EM2 or greater (except at EOY)
    - EM3 shifts can be worked by EM3 or greater (except at EOY)
    - EM4 shifts can only be worked by EM4s

## Trade-Specific
- The resident cannot work the shift being traded out of 
- No resident can work more or fewer shifts than already scheduled for the block
- As the number of changes to the schedule increases, the desirability of the solution decreases
